<p>It is a period of great change at the Swift house.</p>

<p>Isaac is beginning his junior year at GSL High School; he's running cross country and looking forward to leading the programming section on the school's Robotics team in the winter.</p>

<p>Robin has started her freshman year at Montana State (Bozeman), where she's pursuing a degree in nursing. She's really enjoying the hiking and other outdoor opportunities that she's been offered.</p>

<p>After spending the summer interning with Lockheed Martin in Fort Worth, Texas, Chandler is enjoying the coolness of the Minnesota fall again. He's busy spending his time designing silly scrolling websites and doing terrible photoshop work (and also keeping busy with the usual many projects!)<!-- TODO: document projects --></p>

<p>Dave and Celine are enjoying the peace and quiet that comes with the majority of the kids moved out.</p>
